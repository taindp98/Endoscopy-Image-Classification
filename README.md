# Semi-supervised Learning with Transformers for Gastrointestinal Pathologies Classification in Endoscopic Images

• In progress building up a deep learning model using the PyTorch framework to classify the abnormalities in endoscopic images.

• Dealing with the lack of labeled images which is a challenge in medical image analysis by applying Semi-supervised learning.
